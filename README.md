# Spotify_Popularity_Analysis

- The purpose of this project is to use data on a set of 52,000 songs and better understand what makes music popular as well as the  audio  features  that  make  up  specific  genre.
- Another dataset we use is user_rating dataset, which contains explicit feedback, specifically star ratings from 10k users on 5k songs they listened to, on a scale from 0 (lowest) to 4 (highest)
- This project investigate popularity of 52k songs from Spotify using song's features. We first explored the popularity trend with respect to selective features. Then, several machine learning models were conducted to study popularity of songs, which include Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, PCA, Kmeans, Logistic Regression, SVM, Neural Network, and collaborative filtering.
- At the end of the project, we also build a recommender algorithm to create a “personal mixtape” for all 10k users we have explicit feedback for. It contains individualized recommendations as to which 10 songs (out of the 5k) a given user will enjoy most.
